# Notes:

- Permissions: Some commands may require elevated privileges (root access). Consider running this script with sudo if necessary.
    - Command Adjustments:
        - `crontab -u` needs to be specified with a username to list the crontab for a specific user; the example uses `root`.
        - `smbclient` and `showmount` commands may require specific network configurations and permissions to execute properly.
    - Output Handling: All command outputs, including errors, are redirected to the output file for comprehensive information.

    - Sensitive Data: The script includes commands that access potentially sensitive information (e.g., `/etc/shadow`). Ensure this is appropriate for your use case and secure the output file accordingly.
